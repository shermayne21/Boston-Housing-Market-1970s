Boston Housing Market 1970s


Boston is one of the cities that has a huge concentration of college students and young professionals. With its growing population, the housing market has been booming, leading to an exponential increase in the sale price of the homes in the area. The purpose of this research is to understand the Boston home prices in the 1970s based on various variables, focusing on the number of rooms, riverfront property, accessibility to highways, and distance to employment centers. My aim is the determine which different variables are most influential on the housing price. At the end of this research, we will be able to find out how each of the factors affects the home price in Boston.

The dataset I will be using is Boston Housing Dataset. The information in this dataset is collected by the U.S. Census Service which can be found on StatLib archive. You may download the file from url = http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston
